One In The Chamber minigame 

### **What is One In The Chamber?** 

One In The Chamber is a minigame where you spawn with 1 iron sword, 1 bow, and 1 arrow. You have to kill a pre-set amount of people to win the game. You can kill players in 1 shot with your arrow. If you miss, the arrow will be gone. The only way to get arrows is by killing a player.

### **How to set it up?**

Setting it up is easy. All you have to do is set a world spawn (/oitc setworldspawn); after setting a world spawn, you can create a waiting lobby spawn by typing (/oitc setlobby).
Then there is 1 more step, which is creating spawn locations for the player. All you have to do is type the command (/oitc setspawnloc).

How to join a game? Very simple, type the command /oitc join!
